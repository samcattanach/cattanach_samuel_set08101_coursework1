      <p>In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption
         or decryption â€” a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure.
         An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to
         convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous
          with "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the
           concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.
